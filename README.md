### Overview
-----------
Technexion Ubuntu rootfs(Root Filesystem) was be generated by bash scripts, that help the
users to produce a customized ubuntu image using Cananical unique tool named `debootstrap`,
then adapt QEMU to config custom packages and tools from host PC.

**Default username:password = ubuntu:ubuntu**

**Superuser username:password = root:root**

We recommended adapt ubuntu user as normal use, and adapt root user to do deveoping and debuging because Weston is running on root permission, it will not worked if you call GUI relate commands using "ubuntu user".

Features:
* LTS version until 2025/04
* Weston Desktop with GPU accelelation v1.18
* Wayland compositor v1.18.0
* gstreamer1.0 v1.16.2
* VPU libraries v1.18
* QT5 with GPU acceleration  v5.12.8 
* apt-get package manager
* openGL with GPU accelelation
* docker container v19.03.8

### Build-Image
-----------

#### Download the source code

Github way (Prepare git command first is recommended)

Install git first:

    $ sudo apt-get install repo

Download source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/TechNexion-customization/ubuntu-tn-imx8.git

#### Compiling environment setup

General Packages Installation (Ubuntu 18.04 or above)

    $ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential \
    chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect \
    xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping libsdl1.2-dev xterm \
    language-pack-en coreutils texi2html file docbook-utils \
    python-pysqlite2 help2man desktop-file-utils \
    libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mercurial autoconf automake \
    groff curl lzop asciidoc u-boot-tools libreoffice-writer \
    sshpass ssh-askpass zip xz-utils kpartx vim screen \
    debootstrap qemu-system-arm qemu-user-static gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

#### Build a runtime Image


Lazy way, make a runtime image directly:
Note that this BSP does support PICO-IMX8MM with PI only at this moment.

    $ make all
    (it will download the latest u-boot, kernel and rootfs and compile them automatically)

You also can compile the source code separatically:

    $ make u-boot (download and compile the latest u-boot only)
    $ make kernel (download and compile the latest kernel only)
    $ make rootfs (download and compile the latest rootfs only)
    $ make image (package runtime image only, depend on above three items done)
    
#### Flash the image to the target board

Output relative image files of path:

    $ ls output
    kernel  rootfs.tgz  u-boot  ubuntu.img

We provide two ways for image flashing:

**1. `uuu` way**

It's a modular flash tool base on serial download mode, download the tools from technexion website as following link:

Download: [prebuilt binary](ftp://ftp.technexion.net/development_resources/development_tools/installer/imx-mfg-uuu-tool_20200327.zip)

Step 1. Connect a Type-C cable between host PC and the board

Step 2. Change the boot mode from eMMC mode to serial download mode

Step 3. Issue uuu command to flash the compiled Ubuntu image to eMMC:

    $ sudo uuu/linux64/uuu -b emmc_img imx8mm/pico-imx8mm-flash.bin ubuntu.img

Step 4. Change back boot mode from serial download mode to eMMC mode, it should be works!

For Windows OS or want to know the detail users , please click this [link](https://github.com/TechNexion/u-boot-edm/wiki/Use-mfgtool-%22uuu%22-to-flash-eMMC)

**2. `ums` way**

It's a easy way base on u-boot prompt of eMMC boot mode, but the disadvantage is the speed is a little bit lower than `uuu` way, another limitation is it must be existed a works u-boot inside the eMMC, if not, you still need adapt `uuu` way at first.

Step 1. Keep eMMC boot mode

Step 2. Connect a Type-C cable between host PC and the board for image flashing

Step 3. Connect a micro-usb cable between host PC and the board for debeg cosole

Step 4. press enter key on debug console when boot up u-boot, let u-boot into prompt

Step 5. Target board side: Issue ums command to mount eMMC as a mass storage:

    # ums 0 mmc 2

Step 6. Host PC side: Adapt basic `dd` command is enough for image flashing:

    $ sudo dd if=ubuntu.img of=/dev/sdx bs=1M (sdx means the device node which ums mounted storage)
    $ sync
